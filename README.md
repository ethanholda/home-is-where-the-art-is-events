# "Home Is Where The Art Is" Event Redirects

This page lives on main website and serves to redirect users to live events, enabling us to capture Google Analytics data as they pass through.

The page and stylesheets are deployed via git to `/drupal/www/html/webroot/hiwtai-events` on the cmaweb21-bbn.clevelandart.org server.

To add an event, add the slug and event link into the `$events` dictionary.

Links are of the form:
`https://www.clevelandart.org/hiwtai-events/?e=comforts-of-home`
